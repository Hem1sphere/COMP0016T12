# COMP0016T12

For now, it is hosted locally. To run, in root directory, run "python manage.py runserver".
To view admin page, use the account with username "wk" and password "hello123".
Some of the user accounts in the database are not complete, i.e. no profile because the profile feature was added subsequently.
Feel free to create more accounts for testing purposes but for standardisation purposes, use the password "hello123!".
